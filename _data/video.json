        "vidipax": "The 2\" Quad format was the first successful videotape format. By 1956 the format was being used for television broadcasts. The machine used a headwheel with four heads, which gave it the name \"Quadraplex\" or \"Quad\". It rotated at 14,400 rpm or 240 times a second, scanning transversely across 2-inch-wide tape. In order to spin this fast, the headwheel was floated on air bearings using an air compressor. \"High band\" recorders were introduced in 1964 by Ampex, offering a greater frequency response and a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This allowed several generations of duplications to be made without a discernible loss of quality. Super highband was introduced by Ampex and RCA in 1972. The 2\" Quad format was widely used within the industry into the 1980s."

The system included a 21\" color TV, TV tuner, turntable, reel-to-reel audiotape recorder, video camera and VTR. It had a timer to allow for television recordings of up to five hours of black-and-white video. The \"helical scan\" system wrapped the tape around the head drum at a slight angle as the tape was transported from reel to reel. Because the head-drum rotation speed is essentially independent of tape speed, the helical scan method allowed for a viewable picture at pause, slow motion, fast motion or even reverse motion. This was not possible with the Quad machines because an entire field of video is not scanned by one complete pass of the video heads."

With the Sony BVH-1000, it formed the basis of the SMPTE Type C standard. The original 1\" format was then designated as Type A. High friction on the scanner, a flimsy base for the motor and an unusual capstan made machine interchange a problem.

In skip-field recording, only one head actually records. During playback, the record head plays the track once while the second head is offset so that it reads the same track again. All of the CV-format VTRs were interchange-compatible among each other until the introduction of the EIAJ industry-standard-format AV series in the early 1970s."

Both manufacturers had to modify slightly their original designs to create a common format. The 1\" Type C displaced the Quadruplex recorders from all high-end broadcast applications during the 1980s. Unlike the 2\" Quad and 1\" Type B, it offered many features that we now take for granted, such as viewable still frame, slow and fast motion, and picture shuttle. The machine used a full wrap of videotape around the video head assembly and two video record/playback heads inside the assembly. Only one head is used to record and playback the visible part of the picture. The other optional head is used to record sync information."
